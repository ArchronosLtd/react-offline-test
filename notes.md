# Fixed error
There was an error where it was looking for the `<head>` of the HTML to have a `<title>` so I added a simple one to fix the console error.

# config changes
added typescript loader to the `webpack.config.js`
set ES6 as target ES version
Changed the CSS stuff to use SASS to make styling etc easier.

# testing
I have shipped this with a __snapshot__ of the new Chart wrapper component

# running
please run the following commands in order
`npm i`
`npm test`
`npm start`

# things I would change
I was unaware of the "other" category, or energy production and as such
would maybe choose to render using tiles or something, but was told not to spend more than about 90mins on this.

Hopefully I've shown enough to at least show I know what I am doing, I genuinely *really* like the sound of Kiwi Power!
