# Fixed error
There was an error where it was looking for the `<head>` of the HTML to have a `<title>` so I added a simple one to fix the console error.

# config changes
added typescript loader to the `webpack.config.js`
set ES6 as target ES version
Changed the CSS stuff to use SASS to make styling etc easier.

# testing
I have shipped this with a __snapshot__ of the new Chart wrapper component

# running
please run the following commands in order
```
npm i
```

```
npm test
```

```
npm start
```

# things I would change
Make it prettier. Good design takes time, and I was told to try not to spend more than 90mins on the task.

Hopefully I've shown enough to at least show I know what I am doing, I genuinely *really* like the sound of Kiwi Power!

Any question please feel free to contact me through the recruiter!
